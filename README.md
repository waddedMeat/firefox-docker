# firefox-docker

After losing most of a days work fighting to resolve "Error code: ssl_error_weak_server_ephemeral_dh_key", I gave up.

An internal web application in my office returns this lovely error, and Fedora says Ell No!!  For some reason Debian systems don't give a crap, so...

I put together a docker container to run Debian FireFox.  Now I can access the ticketing system at work to enter a ticket for the SAs to fix the certs on the server that runs their ticketing system.
